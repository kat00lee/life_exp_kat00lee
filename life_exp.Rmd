# Abstract 

Here, I examine the famous plot from Oeppen and Vaupel (2002). 

# Analysis

Here, I load in the data. 

Here, I calculated the maximum life expectancy for each year.

```{r}
data("gapminder_unfiltered")

gapminder_unfiltered %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  select(country, year, lifeExp) %>%
  arrange(year)
  

```

Now, I will make a plot
